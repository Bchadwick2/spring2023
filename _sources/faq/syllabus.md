# Syllabus and Grading FAQ



## How much does activity x weigh in my grade?
```{toggle}
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on earning the badges. Everything at a level must be complete and correct. 
```

<!-- 
## Can I submit this assignment late if ...?
```{toggle}
In this class, there are feedback hours instead of deadlines for specific assignments.  If your work is not in by the feedback hours, you will get feedback at the next hours. If your grading contract has dated milestones, (eg for a project) post an issue in your contract repo with title `late milestone: <name of milestone>` and in the body proposes when it will be in instead and how this delay will not affect your future work.  If you need more dramatic shift, propose a revision to your contract.

## I don't understand the feedback  on this assignment
```{toggle}
If you have questions about your feedback, the best thing to do is to start a discussion on the PR for that work. Either reply directly to one of the inline comments, or the summary.

Be specific about what you think is wrong so that we can expand more.

## What should a Deeper exploration look like and where do I put it?
```{toggle}
It should be a tutorial or blog style piece of writing, likely with code
excerpts or screenshots embedded in it.

[an example that uses mostly screenshots](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-10.html)

[an example of heavily annotated code](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-17.html)

They should be markdown files in your KWL repo.  I recommend myst markdown.
```
