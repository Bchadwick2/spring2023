# Syllabus and Grading FAQ



## How much does activity x weigh in my grade?
```{toggle}
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on earning the badges. Everything at a level must be complete and correct. 
```


## How do I keep track of my earned badges?
```{toggle}
You will have several options.  You will have a project board that you can track assigned work, in progress work and earned badges with in one place.  This is quite different than checking your grade in BrightSpace, but using tools like this represents the real tools used by developers. 

Additionally, when we log them in our private gradebook, we will give you a "receipt" that is 128 characters long. You will be able to use provided command line tools and github actions to produce a report of your status at any time from those receipts.  Additionally, at particular points in the course, an in class or class preparation activity will be for you to review a "progress report" that we give you and update your success plan for the course.

## Can I submit this assignment late if ...?
```{toggle}
In this class, there are feedback hours instead of deadlines for specific assignments.  If your work is not in by the feedback hours, you will get feedback at the next hours. If your grading contract has dated milestones, (eg for a project) post an issue in your contract repo with title `late milestone: <name of milestone>` and in the body proposes when it will be in instead and how this delay will not affect your future work.  If you need more dramatic shift, propose a revision to your contract.

## I don't understand the feedback  on this assignment
```{toggle}
If you have questions about your feedback, the best thing to do is to start a discussion on the PR for that work. Either reply directly to one of the inline comments, or the summary.

Be specific about what you think is wrong so that we can expand more.

## What should a Deeper exploration look like and where do I put it?
```{toggle}
It should be a tutorial or blog style piece of writing, likely with code
excerpts or screenshots embedded in it.

[an example that uses mostly screenshots](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-10.html)

[an example of heavily annotated code](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/notes/2021-09-17.html)

They should be markdown files in your KWL repo.  I recommend myst markdown.
```
